# Ton Store

- A place to buy utilities and services for your business.

## Development
This project was build using [Expo](https://expo.dev) so I can test it on more physical devices.

## Installation

It's quite simple to install and run this project, you just need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your computer.

After clone or download the project, open it on your terminal and install all dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
# or if you prefer yarn you can just run:
yarn
```
That's it! now you just have to run the project.

## Running the project

To run this app on your device you will need to have [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) installed, but if you prefer to run this project into a emulator you can choose between [Android](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) or [IOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) (Unfortunately for IOS you'll need to have a Macbook with [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)).

You can just run:
```bash
npm run start
# or with yarn
yarn start
```
And you'll see a menu in your terminal with all available run options.
